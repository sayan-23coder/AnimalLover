              The Lost Animal Web App is designed to help people report and find
              lost or found animals in their communities. Whether itâ€™s a stray
              dog in your neighborhood or an injured animal that needs help, you
              can easily submit a report with a photo and description.
            </p>

              If an animal looks sick or injured, users can send reports
              directly to wildlife or forest authorities. Our goal is to protect
              animals, assist in their recovery, and reconnect them with their
              rightful owners.
